1. **Font and Hero Text:**
   - The font used in the images is Roboto.
   - Hero text is the statement that appears at the top of a web page.

2. **Approach:**
   - Tackling a project like this can be overwhelming, especially when faced with a blank HTML document. Our suggestion: take it one section at a time.
   - The website you’re creating has four main sections (and a footer). Pick one and get it into pretty good shape before moving on. Starting at the top is always a solid plan.

3. **Process:**
   - For each section, begin by getting all the content onto the page before starting to style it. In other words, do the HTML first, then the CSS.
   - You’ll probably have to revisit the HTML once you start styling, but bouncing back and forth from the beginning will take more time and may cause more frustration.
   - Note: You don’t need to use more than one stylesheet. Using a single CSS file is adequate for this project.

4. **Flexbox Reference:**
   - Many elements on this page are similar to those you saw in our flexbox exercises. Feel free to refer back to those exercises if you need a refresher.

5. **Mobile Devices:**
   - Do not worry about making your project look nice on a mobile device. We’ll cover that later.

6. **Final Step:**
   - When you finish, don’t forget to push it up to GitHub!
